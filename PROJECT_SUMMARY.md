# APRA Compliance Monitoring Application - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

A comprehensive, enterprise-grade compliance monitoring system built specifically for APRA (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority) requirements. This application demonstrates real-time transaction monitoring, automated violation detection, and comprehensive compliance reporting following industry best practices.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Principles

### SOLID Principles Implementation ✅
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service and component has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible rule system without modifying existing code
- **Liskov Substitution**: Interchangeable compliance rule implementations
- **Interface Segregation**: Specific interfaces for different functionalities
- **Dependency Inversion**: Services depend on abstractions, not concretions

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) ✅
- Centralized configuration management
- Reusable API service methods
- Shared database models and validation logic
- Common UI components and styling

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) ✅
- Clear, readable code structure
- Intuitive user interface design
- Straightforward API endpoints
- Simple but effective validation rules

### BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) ✅
- Comprehensive feature files with real-world scenarios
- Step definitions covering all compliance workflows
- End-to-end testing of user journeys
- Examples of both passing and failing compliance checks

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### BDD Tests (pytest-bdd)
```gherkin
Feature: APRA Compliance Monitoring
  Scenario: Transaction exceeds APRA limit threshold
    Given a transaction with amount $15000
    And the APRA transaction limit is $10000
    When the transaction is processed
    Then a compliance violation should be detected
    And the violation type should be "TRANSACTION_LIMIT"
    And the violation severity should be "HIGH"
```

### Unit Tests

## 🎯 Compliance Rule Examples

### 1. Transaction Limit Violations
```python
# Example: $15,000 transaction (exceeds $10,000 APRA limit)
{
  "account_id": "ACC123456",
  "amount": 15000.00,
  "transaction_type": "TRANSFER"
}
# Result: HIGH severity violation with automatic flagging
```

### 2. Velocity Pattern Detection
```python
# Example: 12 transactions in 1 hour (exceeds 10 transaction limit)
# Result: CRITICAL severity violation with account freeze recommendation
```

### 3. Geographic Risk Assessment
```python
# Example: Transaction from Iran (high-risk country)
{
  "location_country": "IRN",
  "amount": 5000.00
}
# Result: CRITICAL severity violation requiring enhanced due diligence
```

### 4. Structuring Pattern Detection
```python
# Example: Multiple transactions just under $10,000 threshold
# Amounts: $9,500, $9,800, $9,200, $9,900
# Result: Suspicious pattern detection with investigation requirement
```
